	We move $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ in the CCM
	\\ $\Rightarrow$ runtime is reduced and consume less energy.\newline

	We use the utilization gain of the CCM to run $\tau_3$ at 48 MHz
	\\$\Rightarrow$ runtime is bigger, but, we consume less energy. \newline

	The utilization of the system is still 1 but we can spare energy.
